Demo project
############

The :file:`demo/` folder holds a demo project to illustrate (and test)
django-downloadview usage.


***********************
Browse demo code online
***********************

See `demo folder in project's repository`_.


***************
Deploy the demo
***************

System requirements:

* `Python`_ version 2.6 or 2.7, available as ``python`` command.
  
  .. note::

     You may use `Virtualenv`_ to make sure the active ``python`` is the right
     one.

* ``make`` and ``wget`` to use the provided :file:`Makefile`.

Execute:

.. code-block:: sh

   git clone git@github.com:benoitbryon/django-downloadview.git
   cd django-downloadview/
   make demo

It installs and runs the demo server on localhost, port 8000. So have a look
at http://localhost:8000/

.. note::

   If you cannot execute the Makefile, read it and adapt the few commands it
   contains to your needs.

Browse and use :file:`demo/demoproject/` as a sandbox.
