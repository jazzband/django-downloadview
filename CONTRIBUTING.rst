**************
Create tickets
**************

Please use the `bugtracker`_ **before** starting some work:

* check if the bug or feature request has already been filed. It may have been
  answered too!

* else create a new ticket.

* if you plan to contribute, tell us, so that we are given an opportunity to
  give feedback as soon as possible.

* Then, in your commit messages, reference the ticket with some
  ``refs #TICKET-ID`` syntax.


******************
Use topic branches
******************

* Work in branches.

* Prefix your branch with the ticket ID corresponding to the issue. As an
  example, if you are working on ticket #23 which is about contribute
  documentation, name your branch like ``23-contribute-doc``.

* If you work in a development branch and want to refresh it with changes from
  master, please `rebase`_ or `merge-based rebase`_, i.e. do not merge master.
