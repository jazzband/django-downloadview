`django-downloadview` has been tested with Python version 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4.

Installing `django-downloadview` will automatically trigger the installation of
the following requirements:

.. literalinclude:: /../setup.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: BEGIN requirements
   :end-before: END requirements

In most cases, you will use `django-downloadview` as a dependency of another
project. In such a case, you should add `django-downloadview` in your main
project's requirements. Typically in :file:`setup.py`:

.. code:: python

   from setuptools import setup

   setup(
       install_requires=[
           'django-downloadview',
           #...
       ]
       # ...
   )

Then when you install your main project with your favorite package manager
(like `pip`_), `django-downloadview` and its recursive dependencies will
automatically be installed.
