Big refactoring around middleware configuration, API readability and
documentation.

  checks only response's ``streaming_content`` attribute.

  "text-mode" and "binary-mode" content.
  See https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/21321

- Feature #50 - Introduced ``django_downloadview.DownloadDispatcherMiddleware``
  that iterates over a list of configurable download middlewares. Allows to
  plug several download middlewares with different configurations.

  This middleware is mostly dedicated to internal usage. It is used by
  ``SmartDownloadMiddleware`` described below.

- Feature #42 - Documentation shows how to stream generated content (yield).
  Introduced ``django_downloadview.StringIteratorIO``.

- Refactoring #51 - Dropped support of Python 2.6

- Refactoring #25 - Introduced ``django_downloadview.SmartDownloadMiddleware``
  which allows to setup multiple optimization rules for one backend.

  Deprecates the following settings related to previous single-and-global
  middleware:

  * ``NGINX_DOWNLOAD_MIDDLEWARE_MEDIA_ROOT``
  * ``NGINX_DOWNLOAD_MIDDLEWARE_MEDIA_URL``
  * ``NGINX_DOWNLOAD_MIDDLEWARE_EXPIRES``
  * ``NGINX_DOWNLOAD_MIDDLEWARE_WITH_BUFFERING``
  * ``NGINX_DOWNLOAD_MIDDLEWARE_LIMIT_RATE``

- Refactoring #52 - ObjectDownloadView now inherits from SingleObjectMixin and
  BaseDownloadView (was DownloadMixin and BaseDetailView).
  Simplified DownloadMixin.render_to_response() signature.

- Refactoring #40 - Documentation includes examples from demo project.

- Refactoring #39 - Documentation focuses on usage, rather than API. Improved
  narrative documentation.

- Refactoring #53 - Added base classes in ``django_downloadview.middlewares``,
  such as ``ProxiedDownloadMiddleware``.

- Refactoring #54 - Expose most Python API directly in `django_downloadview`
  package. Simplifies ``import`` statements in client applications.
  Splitted nginx module in a package.

- Added unit tests, improved code coverage.


1.2 (2013-05-28)
----------------

Bugfixes and documentation improvements.

- Bugfix #26 - Prevented computation of virtual file's size, unless the file
  wrapper implements was_modified_since() method.

  time.

- Bugfix #35 - Fixed README conversion from reStructuredText to HTML (PyPI).


1.1 (2013-04-11)
----------------

Various improvements.
Contains **backward incompatible changes.**

- Added HTTPDownloadView to proxy to arbitrary URL.

- Using StreamingHttpResponse introduced with Django 1.5. Makes Django 1.5 a
  requirement!

- Added ``django_downloadview.test.assert_download_response`` utility.

- Download views and response now use file wrappers. Most logic around file
  attributes, formerly in views, moved to wrappers.

- Replaced DownloadView by PathDownloadView and StorageDownloadView. Use the
  right one depending on the use case.


1.0 (2012-12-04)
----------------
