This document presents other projects that provide similar or complementary
functionalities. It focuses on differences with django-downloadview.


*************************
Django's static file view
*************************

`Django has a builtin static file view`_. It can stream files. As explained in
Django documentation, it is designed for development purposes. For production,
static files'd better be served by some optimized server.

Django-downloadview can replace Django's builtin static file view:

* perform actions with Django when receiving download requests: check
  permissions, generate files, gzip, logging, signals...
* delegate actual download to a reverse proxy for increased performance.
* disable optimization middlewares or decorators in development, if you want to
  serve files with Django.


***************
django-sendfile
***************

`django-sendfile`_ is a wrapper around web-server specific methods for sending
files to web clients.

API is made of a single ``sendfile()`` function.

Views call the ``sendfile`` function. They don't care about the backend.
There, django-downloadview's class-based views return some DownloadResponse.

Optimizations are supported via backends. Backends are configured in settings.
There, django-downloadview uses middlewares instead.

It seems that django-senfile main focus is simplicity, whereas
django-downloadview main focus is reusability. You may choose
django-downloadview if you need integration with class-based views.

As of 2012-12-10, ``django-sendfile`` seems quite popular and may be a good
alternative.


********************
django-private-files
********************

`django-private-files`_ provides utilities for controlling access to static
files based on conditions you can specify within your Django application.


**********************
django-protected-files
**********************

`django-protected-files`_ is a Django application that lets you serve protected
static files via your frontend server after authorizing the user against
``django.contrib.auth``.

As of 2012-12-10, this project seems inactive.
