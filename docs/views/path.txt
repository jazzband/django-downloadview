.. py:module:: django_downloadview.views.path

:class:`PathDownloadView` **serves file given a path on local filesystem**.

Use this view whenever you just have a path, outside storage or model.

.. warning::

   Take care of path validation, especially if you compute paths from user
   input: an attacker may be able to download files from arbitrary locations.
   In most cases, you should consider managing files in storages, because they
   implement default security mechanisms.


**************
Simple example
**************

Setup a view to stream files given path:

.. literalinclude:: /../demo/demoproject/path/views.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 1-14
   :emphasize-lines: 14


************
Base options
************

:class:`PathDownloadView` inherits from
:class:`~django_downloadview.views.base.DownloadMixin`, which has various
options such as :attr:`~django_downloadview.views.base.DownloadMixin.basename`
or :attr:`~django_downloadview.views.base.DownloadMixin.attachment`.


**************************
Computing path dynamically
**************************

Override the :meth:`PathDownloadView.get_path` method to adapt path
resolution to your needs:

.. literalinclude:: /../demo/demoproject/path/views.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 1-9, 15-

The view accepts a ``path`` argument you can setup either in ``as_view`` or
via URLconfs:

.. literalinclude:: /../demo/demoproject/path/urls.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 1-7, 11-13, 14
