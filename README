Django-DownloadView provides (class-based) generic download views for Django.

Example, in some urls.py:

.. code-block:: python

   from django.conf.urls import url, url_patterns
   from django_downloadview import ObjectDownloadView
   from demoproject.download.models import Document  # A model with a FileField


   # ObjectDownloadView inherits from django.views.generic.BaseDetailView.
   download = ObjectDownloadView.as_view(model=Document, file_field='file')

   url_patterns = ('',
       url('^download/(?P<slug>[A-Za-z0-9_-]+)/$', download, name='download'),
   )

Several views are provided to cover frequent use cases:

* ``ObjectDownloadView`` when you have a model with a file field.
* ``StorageDownloadView`` when you manage files in a storage.
* ``PathDownloadView`` when you have an absolute filename on local filesystem.
* ``VirtualDownloadView`` when you the file is generated on the fly.

See :doc:`views` for details.

Then get increased performances with :doc:`optimizations/index`.
